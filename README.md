# Abstract

The outline of the game “Confusion” portrays how a simple yet attractive game
can be developed using Pygame, a platform to develop video games associated with
Python programming language. This game uses the motion of a ball and attached
sound effects with each movement. It is a simple ability test for the reflexes
and motion control of the user. The urge to survive without hitting the wall or
the gradually increasing obstacles on the screen makes the game more addicting
and involving.


# Implementation

1:  The motion of the ball is tested with the four motion (arrow) keys with
    added sound effects.
2:  A boundary is added to fix the layout of the screen and test the collision
    conditions.
3:  Extra obstacles on the screen are generated at regular intervals using the
    random function.
4:  The opening and ending screens to stay in the game or leave and other
    features that enhance the appearance are included.
